# Global-COVID-19-Death-Rates-Performance
This dashboard is designed to deliver quick yet detailed insights into the global performance of COVID-19 death rates
1. New Deaths by Country/Region
A line graph highlights the most recent spikes in COVID-19 deaths across countries.

The United States shows the highest number of new deaths (1,076), followed by Brazil (614), India (637), and Peru (575).

Countries like Iraq (96) and Argentina (120) show lower new death numbers, suggesting varying stages of pandemic waves.

2. Cumulative Deaths by Country
A horizontal bar chart shows total death counts.

The US leads with 148,011 total deaths, followed by Brazil (87,618), UK (45,844), Mexico (44,022), and Italy (35,112).

This visualization reveals long-term patterns and the cumulative impact in some of the hardest-hit countries.

3. Weekly Death Rate by Region
This bar chart compares weekly death rates across WHO regions:

Africa surprisingly shows the highest weekly death rate (868), ahead of the Americas (572), which typically report more total cases.

Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific have significantly lower rates, potentially due to population demographics, mitigation strategies, or reporting differences.

4. Daily Deaths Across Age Groups
Age-stratified data emphasizes vulnerability:

Individuals aged 75â€“90 are the most affected, with 50 daily deaths, followed by 60â€“75 (37 deaths) and 90â€“105 (32 deaths).

This underscores the urgent need to prioritize elderly populations for medical care and preventive strategies.

5. Confirmed Cases by WHO Region
A donut chart shows how the confirmed case load is distributed:

Americas dominate with over 8.8 million cases, followed by Europe (3.3 million) and South-East Asia (1.8 million).

This context helps in correlating case load with death rates and understanding healthcare system pressures.

6. Weekly Death Occurrence Trend
This line graph shows how death tolls evolved over time:

There's a noticeable downward trend, from a high of 455,582 to 15,912, with a few intermittent spikes.

This could reflect waves of infections, vaccination rollouts, or policy responses across countries.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
The disparity between confirmed cases and death rates in some regions (e.g., Africa) suggests possible underreporting or systemic healthcare challenges.

The consistently high mortality in older age groups reinforces the importance of tailored public health interventions.

The US has consistently ranked highest in both new deaths and total deaths, indicating ongoing systemic challenges despite high resource availability.

Regional analysis helps highlight underrepresented areas that may need more attention or support, especially in reporting and healthcare access.
